## Samurai: the crossing attack (replaces the old basic attacks)

Instead of his plain melee combo, he attacks, then dashes to the other side of the player. He leaves a mirror image
behind that attacks too, and then he attacks from the new side. The rhythm should be right for the player to turn
around for each attack and deflect it: front, behind, front (or the reverse), each one readable and each one on a beat.

Notes for when it is built:
- Reuses the mirror image, the flash step and the Judgement Cut dash (`MirrorDashTime`, `MirrorBehind`) from the phase 3 work.
- The beat between swings is the thing to tune: long enough to turn and raise the sword, short enough to feel like a chain.

## Long-term: deflects need the right facing

A deflect only works if the player faces the attack. Combined with the crossing attack above, this makes turning a
real part of the fight. It changes every boss (Samurai, Leaf Ranger, Gunslinger), so it needs a design pass on ranged
attacks first: arrows and bullets from behind would need a tell.
